# 🚀 Car Price Prediction - ML Model Deployment 🚀  

## Project Overview  
Excited to share my latest project where I built and deployed a **machine learning regression model** to predict car prices! 🔥  

### **Project Highlights:** 
✅ **Dataset** – Used a **Kaggle dataset** containing features like **Price, Manufacturer, Model, Production Year, Category, Fuel Type, Engine Volume, and Mileage** to predict car prices accurately.
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, removed duplicates, checked for outliers, and applied various preprocessing techniques to clean the dataset.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovered key insights and relationships within the dataset to enhance feature selection.  
✅ **Feature Engineering** – Transformed and optimized features for better model performance.  
✅ **Model Building** – Implemented **XGBoost**, trained and tested the model, and fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracy.  
✅ **Web App Development** – Deployed the model using **Flask**, creating an interactive web application with **HTML & CSS** for user input.  
  

🔗 Now, users can input vehicle details and get an **instant price prediction** through the web app!  

💡 This project was a great hands-on experience in **machine learning, model deployment, and full-stack integration**. Excited to explore more real-world applications!  

🔍 **Looking forward to feedback and discussions!** 🚀
